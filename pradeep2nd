Step 1: Open the Folder in VS Code
Open Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
Go to File > Open Folder and select the folder you want to push to GitHub.
Step 2: Initialize Git (if not already initialized)
Open the Terminal in VS Code by going to View > Terminal.
Run the following command to initialize Git in the folder if itâ€™s not already a Git repository:
bash
Copy code
git init
Step 3: Create a GitHub Repository
Go to GitHub and sign in.
Click on New (next to "Repositories") to create a new repository.
Give your repository a name and choose if it should be public or private.
Do not initialize with a README (since your local folder already contains files). Click Create repository.
Copy the repository URL (e.g., https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git).
Step 4: Add the GitHub Repository as a Remote
In VS Code's terminal, link your local folder to the GitHub repository by running:
bash
Copy code
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
Step 5: Stage, Commit, and Push the Files
Stage All Files:

Go to the Source Control panel in VS Code (icon that looks like a branch).
Click + next to the files you want to stage, or click + at the top to stage all.
Or, you can stage all files in the terminal:

bash
Copy code
git add .
Commit the Changes:

In the Source Control panel, type a commit message in the message box (e.g., "Initial commit") and click the checkmark to commit.
Or, use the terminal:

bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Initial commit"
Push to GitHub:

In the terminal, push the changes to the main branch:
bash
Copy code
git push -u origin main
Step 6: Verify the Changes on GitHub
Go to your GitHub repository in your browser.
Refresh the page to see the files you just pushed.
